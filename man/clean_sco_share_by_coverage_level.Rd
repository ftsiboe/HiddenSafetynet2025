\usage{
clean_sco_share_by_coverage_level(sob)
}
\arguments{
\item{sob}{A \code{data.table} (or data.frame) of SOB records that already
contain aggregated acre and dollar fields. Must include at least:
\code{insured_acres}, \code{endorsed_acres}, \code{insurance_plan_code},
\code{coverage_level_percent}, \code{commodity_year}, \code{state_code}, \code{county_code},
\code{commodity_code}, \code{type_code}, \code{practice_code}.}
}
\value{
A \code{data.table} with unique rows by
\verb{commodity_year, state_code, county_code, commodity_code, type_code, practice_code, insurance_plan_code, coverage_level_percent} and column:
\code{sco} (share in [0,1]).
}
\description{
Computes the Supplemental Coverage Option (SCO) \strong{share of insured acres} by
coverage level for base plans (1=YP, 2=RP, 3=RP-HPE), using SCO plan codes
31-33 mapped back to 1-3.
}
\details{
\itemize{
\item Base data are summed for plans \code{1:3}.
\item SCO records are selected via plan codes \code{31:33} and then remapped to
\code{1:3} (subtract 30) to align with corresponding base plans.
\item SCO share is computed as \code{endorsed_acres / insured_acres} by key and
coverage level.
