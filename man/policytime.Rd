\title{Add U.S. Farm Policy Vertical Lines and Labels to a ggplot}
\usage{
policytime(pty, plot, size)
}
\arguments{
\item{pty}{A numeric vector of y-axis positions for label placement.
The length of the vector determines which policy annotations are added:
\itemize{
\item 1st: 1980 Act
\item 2nd: 1994 Act
\item 3rd: 1996 Farm Bill
\item 4th: 2000 Agricultural Risk Protection Act
\item 5th: 2008 Farm Bill
\item 6th: 2014 Farm Bill
\item 7th: 2018 Farm Bill
}}

\item{plot}{A \code{ggplot} object to which policy lines and labels will be added.}

\item{size}{A numeric value indicating the text size of the policy labels.}
}
\value{
A \code{ggplot} object with added vertical dashed lines and corresponding
text labels for each policy year provided.
}
\description{
This function overlays vertical lines and text labels on a ggplot object to mark major
U.S. agricultural policy events (e.g., Farm Bills or Acts). The vertical lines are drawn
at specific years, and labels are positioned based on values provided in the \code{pty} vector.
}
\details{
The lines and labels are added in brown color with dashed lines (\code{lty=5}), and labels
are rotated vertically. Labels are only drawn if the corresponding index exists in \code{pty}.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
base_plot <- ggplot(data, aes(x = commodity_year, y = value)) +
  geom_line()
policy_positions <- c(10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40)
annotated_plot <- policytime(policy_positions, base_plot, size = 3)
print(annotated_plot)
}
