# Script: 001_clean_rma_sobtpu.R
#
# Description:
#   This script processes RMA Statement of Business (SOB) data for 2014–2025.
#   It prepares an analysis-ready dataset that includes:
#     - Aggregated insured acres, liability, premiums, subsidies, and indemnities
#     - Supplemental Coverage Option (SCO) shares by coverage level
#     - Enhanced Coverage Option (ECO) shares (eco90 and eco95)
#
#   The output is saved as an RDS file:
#     data/rma_sob_with_sco_eco.rds
#
# Steps performed:
#   1. Load SOB data using get_sob_data()
#   2. Filter by relevant insurance plans, coverage type, and reporting level
#   3. Normalize plan codes to align endorsements with base plans
#   4. Aggregate insured acres and financial metrics
#   5. Calculate SCO shares and ECO shares relative to insured acres
#   6. Merge results into a single dataset
#   7. Clean invalid values (0, NA, Inf) and cap SCO/ECO shares at 1
#   8. Save the processed dataset as an RDS file
