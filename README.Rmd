**Abstract:** Many U.S. farmers, growers, and ranchers depend on federally subsidized crop insurance to manage production risks. However, even the most comprehensive policies typically trigger indemnities only after a 15% loss. Supplemental insurance products were introduced to bridge this gap but remain underutilized. Using 958,658 sub-county aggregated insurance transactions and applying recent calibration and simulation methods, our analysis shows that limited adoption of supplemental coverage leaves substantial benefits untapped. While base crop insurance provides foundational protection, integrating supplemental policies significantly enhances downside risk management and income smoothing. Despite higher associated premiums, benefit-per-premium ratios still support broader adoption of supplemental coverages.  

**Keywords:** crop insurance; supplemental coverage; subsidies; insurance utilization  

**JEL Codes:** Q12, Q14, Q18, G22, R52
